# WalkieTalkie
WalkieTalkie is a real-time communication application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) with TypeScript. This project aims to provide a seamless and efficient platform for instant  voice communication, similar to traditional walkie-talkies but with modern web technologies.
